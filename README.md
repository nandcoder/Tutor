# Tutor

## This app is made using ReactJS and FaceAPI.JS
- It uses faceapi.js models for facial recognition and recognizing the facial expressions of detected faces. It takes video using webcam and the recognition is applied to it.
- The contact us page is made for any feedback or query. It sends the data to a dummy backend. You can change the backend from `/src/components/Contact.js`. Change the url at line 20 `const URL = {BACKEND_URL}`.
